**This project has deviated from its original cause and ended up as a simple matlab Simulink models.**
**Yet I wish to come back when I obtain good practical data, to use some ML algorithms to get controlling signals to UPFC**

# UPFC
**single phase unified power flow controller**

This repo is a collection of some of the files, that are developed in the process of designing and simulating a single phase UPFC.
Most of the files you find here will be in .m format, so If you don't have matlab, get a open source software Octave


~~want to contribute to our project?:+1:~~

You can simply get started with :octocat:github GUI or

If you are using git shell:
>- add git repo by `git remote add https://github.com/Sai-K/UPFC/`
>- use `git pull https://github.com/Sai-K/UPFC/ master` from git shell to fork the entire repo
>- start editing your repo locally
>- to create new files use `touch filename` in the git shell
>- use `git add filename` to dock the edit
>- log the commit by `git commit -m "log mesasage" `
>- finally use `git push -u origin new` to add your file

Or else you can simply [Watch](https://github.com/Sai-K/UPFC/subscription):eyes: the project for updates
